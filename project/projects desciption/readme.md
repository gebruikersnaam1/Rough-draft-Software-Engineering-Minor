In this minor you must choose a project from a selection of four. The projects feature a mix of interpreters, compilers, code generators, generic components, and are all mostly centered around type safety.

The projects may be done by an individual student.

The project will be presented twice\: halfway during the minor (at the end of OP3), for a go/no\-go/reparation, and at the end of the minor (at the end of OP4).

The evaluation criteria will be explained in each project.


> Note: it is very strongly advised to adopt a functional programming style, and to exclusively write referentially transparent (read\: _pure_) functions everywhere. Failure to do so, will not imply a lower grade, but it will most definitely make your life as a developer much much harder.
